{"id":"4379c6b5","title":"MangaDex","description":"For users that need to migrate from the old **MangaDex** IDs to the new **MangaDex** UUIDs, one of our contributors has made a small app that migrates all the manga at once with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ivaniskandar/tachiyomi-mangadex-migrator/releases/latest\r\n\r\n## To use this app, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n**1.** Make a backup of your library. \r\n\r\n> Make sure it isn't corrupted by trying to restore from that backup\r\n\r\n**2.** Let the app process the backup. If any manga are skipped, the app will say why.\r\n**3.** Remove all MangaDex manga from your library to prevent duplicates. \r\n\r\n> You can do this by searching \"mangadex\" in the search bar, tap and holding a manga, then press the select all button (tap the image link below to see what it looks like), and finally tap the trash can.\r\n\r\n> Do not check \"Downloaded chapters\" if you'd like to keep your downloaded chapters.
