        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For users that need to migrate from the old **MangaDex** IDs to the new **MangaDex** UUIDs, one of our contributors has made a small app that migrates all the manga at once with perfect accuracy.

https://github.com/ivaniskandar/tachiyomi-mangadex-migrator/releases/latest

## To use this app, follow these steps:

**1.** Make a backup of your library. 

> Make sure it isn't corrupted by trying to restore from that backup

**2.** Let the app process the backup. If any manga are skipped, the app will say why.
**3.** Remove all MangaDex manga from your library to prevent duplicates. 

> You can do this by searching "mangadex" in the search bar, tap and holding a manga, then press the select all button (tap the image link below to see what it looks like), and finally tap the trash can.

> Do not check "Downloaded chapters" if you'd like to keep your downloaded chapters. The downloaded chapters should be automatically detected once you restore.

**4.** Restore the new backup. Make sure it ends in .proto.gz or .json

Important that you do **step 3** as there's no way to automatically sort out the old manga.]]></summary>
