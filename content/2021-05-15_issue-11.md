**MangaPark** and **bato.to** are providing temporary links rather than permanent links to images.

To get around this, you must clear the chapter cache under `More → Settings → Advanced`, tap `Clear chapter cache`, then download the chapter, as the other page links may be expired by the time they are loaded.
